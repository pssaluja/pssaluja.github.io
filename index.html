    <h2>The Medical Negligence Case</h2>
    <p>
    This is to inform you that my father passed away due to gross medical negligence at your hospital under Dr. Suresh Kumar Singhvi.
    </p>
    <p>Here’s what happened:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My father was admitted for a routine laparoscopic gallbladder surgery in January 2025.</li>
        <li>Instead, an open surgery was done without clear explanation.</li>
        <li>That night, he complained of severe pain, but no timely care was provided.</li>
        <li>The next day, a second 7+ hour surgery was performed. He was then placed on a ventilator.</li>
        <li>Over the next two months, despite constant false reassurances from Dr. Singhvi, his condition only got worse.</li>
        <li>He passed away on March 10, 2025, after over ₹35 lakhs were spent.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>On top of this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your staff – especially Dr. Singhvi and Dr. Satendra Katoch – harassed us daily for money, even when my father’s condition was critical.</li>
        <li>We stayed quiet at the time, hoping for his recovery, but we now see how careless and unethical the treatment was.</li>
    </ul>
