*A man of strength, joy, and unwavering love.*

My father, Gurdeep Singh Saluja, was more than just a patient—he was a father, a husband, and a vibrant soul full of love, laughter, and loyalty.  
He was known for:
- His positive spirit and joyful heart  
- His devotion to his family  
- His deep faith and compassion for others

We miss him every single day.

## 📅 What Happened

**January 8, 2025** — Our world was shattered. My father was admitted to **Ganga Ram Hospital** in New Delhi for what was supposed to be a routine laparoscopic gallbladder surgery.

Instead:
- The procedure was **converted to open surgery without consent**
- His post-surgical pain was **ignored**
- A second 7+ hour surgery was performed the next day without clear communication
- He was placed on a ventilator for nearly two months
- Despite our constant concern, we were falsely reassured—again and again

On **March 10, 2025**, after enduring unimaginable suffering, he passed away.

## ⚠️ Who Is Responsible?

We hold **Dr. Suresh Kumar Singhvi**, the primary doctor, directly responsible for misleading us and mishandling my father's treatment.

*Dr. Suresh Singhvi, the GI Surgeon under whose care my father suffered.*

In addition, **Dr. Satendra Katoch**, Director of Medical Services at Ganga Ram, extorted our family—threatening to halt treatment unless massive payments were made privately.

These individuals not only failed in their duties as doctors, but **actively harmed us through deception and abuse of power.**

## 🏥 The Scam at Ganga Ram Hospital

Ganga Ram Hospital has a pattern:

- Families of critically ill patients are pressured to shift them to **general wards**, disguised as a cost-saving move.
- These wards lack adequate care, and many patients **die within 48 hours**—which helps the hospital **manipulate their official death statistics**.
- False hope is sold, not healthcare.

I have received messages from **multiple families** who’ve faced similar horrors. This is not an isolated case—it is a **systemic issue**.

## 📸 What Neglect Looks Like

> ⚠️ *Graphic Content Warning*

![Photo of surgical wound and VAC dressing](/assets/images/wound.jpg)  
*This is what medical negligence looks like.*

We were told a **VAC dressing** would help—but the person handling it wasn’t a trained medical professional. It was outsourced. We paid out of pocket in cash, just to keep the wound from worsening.

## 💔 Why I Built This Website

To honor my father’s memory.  
To expose the truth.  
To protect other families.

We could not save him—but we can make sure those responsible are held accountable. I want to ensure **this never happens again**.
