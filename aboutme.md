### What Happened?

On January 8th, 2025 our lifes changed forever. My father was admitted to a hospital in Delhi, India for a routine surgery. However, due to medical negligence, he suffered severe complications that led to his untimely death.

### Why am I doing this?

I am creating this website to raise awareness about medical negligence and to seek justice for my father. I want to ensure that no other family has to go through the pain and suffering that we have endured.

### Who is responsible for this?

The hospital and the medical professionals involved in my father's care are responsible for the negligence that led to his death. I am determined to hold them accountable for their actions.

### Scam at Ganga Ram Hospital

The Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi, where my father was treated, has a history of medical negligence and malpractice. I have gathered evidence and testimonies from other patients who have suffered due to the hospital's negligence. I will use this information to build a strong case against them and seek justice for my father.
