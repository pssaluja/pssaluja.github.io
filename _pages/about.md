I am a Lead High-Performance Computing Engineer at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) working at the [Center for Computation & Visualization](https://ccv.brown.edu/). I manage the university's main HPC cluster, OSCAR, supporing researchers across campus. My work includes compute, storage, networking, and building software environments using Spack and containers. I enjoy working with the new emerging hardware and software. 

Previously, I worked at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), where I supported large-scale genomic computing. I helped build a dedicated HPC cluster for [Illumina DRAGEN (Dynamic Read Analysis for GENomics)](https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/informatics-products/dragen-secondary-analysis.html) systems and worked with SLURM and Kubernetes in hybrid on-prem and cloud environments. 

Earlier, I was an HPC Administrator at [Purdue University](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/). I have over seven years fo full-time experience working with high-performance computing systems. 

## Educational Background:

I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), where I worked closely with [Stephen Bach](stephenbach.net). My research focussed on parallel file-systems. During this time, AI research was rapidly expanding, and I became interested in building large-scale training clusters and optimizing infrastructure for machine learning workloads. I worked closely on GPUDirect Storage to reduce training times. 

I also hold a Masters of Business Administration from the University of Rhode Island, which compliments my technical background with experience in leadership, operations, and decision-making.
