I am a Lead High-Performance Computing Engineer at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) working at the [Center for Computation & Visualization](https://ccv.brown.edu/). I manage the university's main HPC cluster, OSCAR, supporing researchers across campus. My work includes compute, storage, networking, and building software environments using Spack and containers. I enjoy working with the new emerging hardware and software. 

Previously, I worked at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), where I supported large-scale genomic computing. I helped build a dedicated HPC cluster for [Illumina DRAGEN (Dynamic Read Analysis for GENomics)](https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/informatics-products/dragen-secondary-analysis.html) systems and worked with SLURM and Kubernetes in hybrid on-prem and cloud environments. 

Earlier, I was an HPC Administrator at [Purdue University](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/). I have over seven years fo full-time experience working with high-performance computing systems. 

Education:

I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at Brown University, where I worked closely with [Stephen Bach](stephenbach.net). My research focussed on parallel file-systems. During this time, AI research was rapidly expanding, and I became interested in building large-scale training clusters and optimizing infrastructure for machine learning workloads. I worked closely on GPUDirect Storage to reduce training times. 

I also hold a Masters of Business Administration from the University of Rhode Island, which compliments my technical background with experience in leadership, operations, and decision-making.  


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
